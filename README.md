# Java agent plugin extensions for Apache SkyWalking
Due to license incompatibilities/restrictions, some plugins are hosted in here.

Including
1. Resin 3
1. Resin 4
1. Oracle JDBC Driver
1. Aliyun ONS 1.x

To be clear, these plugins have no license issue, but need Apache 2.0 uncompatible license Jar file to compile, which is not allowed to do in Apache. 

2.0+ releases require SkyWalking 8.2.0+
